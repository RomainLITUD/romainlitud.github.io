## About Me
Guopeng LI has an international and multi-disciplinary educational background. 
-I received the B.S. degree in *physics* from *Nanjing University* (China) in 2015. Then I came to *ENSTA-Paris* (France) and received the Engineering Diploma and Master's degree in *applied mathematics* in 2018. Now I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in *transport and planning* at *Delft University of Technology* (Netherlands) under the supervision of Prof.dr.ir.J.W.C(Hans) van Lint. If you want to contact me, welcome to send an email to (G.Li-5@tudelft.nl)

## Research Interests

- **Intelligent Transportation Systems**
